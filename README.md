# TSP_with_Tabu_Search_Algorithm
TREVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP) was tried to be solved with a METAHEURISTIC approach which is TABU SEARCH

The "Tabu Search Algorithm" was used for to solve TSP. 

You can input which city will be the begining, number of cities, length of tabu list and iteration number. 

Also you can input the distances with hand, from a text file or random which has distrubted uniformly by programme.

This code use for the symmetrical distances but the unsymmetrical model will also be developed soon.
